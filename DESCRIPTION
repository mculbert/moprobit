Description: This package estimates general multivariate ordinal probit models
    via Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Outcomes can be specified in ordered blocks
    with prediction of subsequent blocks including outcomes from previous
    blocks. Estimation handles missing data seamlessly, and can account for
    measurement error in continuous predictors. Continuous outcomes may be
    estimated alongside the binary/ordinal probit outcomes.
